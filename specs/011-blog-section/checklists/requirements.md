**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-01-27
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

- All checklist items pass validation
- Specification is ready for `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
- No clarifications needed - requirements are clear from the input and existing site structure
- The specification focuses on WHAT users need (blog functionality, automatic post discovery, navigation integration) and WHY (content publishing, discoverability, maintainability) without specifying HOW (specific Jekyll plugins, exact directory structure, implementation details)
- Assumptions document reasonable defaults (Jekyll conventions, Markdown format, date formats) without requiring clarification
- Edge cases are comprehensively covered including missing fields, empty states, pagination, and filtering scenarios
